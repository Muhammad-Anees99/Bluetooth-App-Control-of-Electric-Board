# Bluetooth Control of Electric Board
 ðŸ”§ Project Overview:
A 180-degree servo motor, programmed through the Microcontroller, precisely rotates to press the electric board's button. Wireless control is enabled through a smartphone communicating with the HC-05 module via UART signals.

ðŸ¤– System Functionality:
The Microcontroller acts as the central processing unit, executing a custom algorithm that interprets Bluetooth commands and controls the servo motor, resulting in a user-friendly interface.

ðŸ“± User Interface & Bluetooth App Integration:
Designed a user-friendly Bluetooth app allowing seamless control of the electric board. Voice commands and timer functionality enhance user experience, making it accessible for users with varying technical backgrounds.
